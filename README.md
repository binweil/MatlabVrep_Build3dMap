# MatlabVrep_Build3dMap
This reporsitory allow people to build a 3d map in Vrep simulation through a matlab program (No RemoteAPI in this version).
The Matlab program takes a "neutralized" text file with map informations. The program will convert the text file to a .obj file, which can be directly imported into Vrep.
